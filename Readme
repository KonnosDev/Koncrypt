# Koncrypt
Koncrypt is an case sensitive encryption language.




The "Bigger picture":

Most encryption languages encrypt characters with a certain key, Koncrypt doesnt follow this principle, I made the libaries randomly so the encrypted outputs 
will look like random greek,symbols and number characters. Also the fact that its case sensitive make the outputs even more random. Personally I think that its more secure because without the integrated decryptor or the decryption library it would be very hard to decypher the encrypted phrases (for example in Ceasars code you can decypher phrases easily if you know the key or slowly if you try different keys).

Why I made it:

I made this language so I can practice python basics. Because after a year of studying for my final exams I got a bit rusty on python coding.

The potential uses and future:
For now it can be used for fun ways like communicating with a friend or encrypting phrases you would like to keep secret from others. But in the future I have plans for a new upgraded and even more secured Koncrypt 2.0 that will have multiple encrypted libraries, better UI, and much more.
